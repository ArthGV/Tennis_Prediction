      "\n",
      "Both men are contesting their 25th tour-level final and will walk onto Campo Centrale not before 5:00 p.m. CEST with plenty at stake.\n",

      "Sinner is making his return to Tour for the first time since he won his third major at the Australian Open in January, but has shown little sign of rust. The No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings has just dropped one set en route to the final and delivered a commanding 6-0, 6-1 quarter-final dismantling of Casper Ruud before he recovered from losing the first set 1-6 against Tommy Paul to advance in the semis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now just one win away from claiming his fifth Masters 1000 crown and first on clay, the 23-year-old is bidding to become only the second Italian in history to triumph in Rome after Adriano Panatta in 1976.\n",
      "\n",
      "But standing in his way is a familiar foe. Alcaraz leads the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series 6-4, including wins in their past three encounters. On clay, they‚Äôre tied at 1-1: Sinner won the 2022 Umag final, while Alcaraz prevailed in last year‚Äôs Roland Garros semi-final en route to the crown.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We know each other quite well now,\" Sinner said when asked about Alcaraz. \"It's always special to share the court with him. I feel like we both know how to play against each other a little bit, so we have to be prepared tactically. Of course, small things are going to be changed. But it's just a great test for me to see where I am.\n",
      "\n",
      "‚ÄúIt's great for me to play against Carlos before the two Grand Slams. That for me is good because I see where I have to improve, what I have to do better. But hopefully it‚Äôs going to be a good match.‚Äù\n",
      "\n",
      "Alcaraz, meanwhile, enters the final with the most match wins on Tour in 2025 (29) and is eyeing a Tour-leading third title of the season. Like Sinner, though, the 22-year-old arrived in the Italian capital with question marks after missing his home Masters 1000 event in Madrid due to injury.Any lingering doubts have been put to bed this fortnight, with Alcaraz dispatching Top 10 stars Jack Draper and Lorenzo Musetti en route to his eighth Masters 1000 final (6-1). While Alcaraz is known for his flair and charismatic style, he‚Äôs been happy with the maturity he‚Äôs shown on court in the Italian capital.\"Sometimes it's difficult because sometimes when I see the ball coming, a lot of things come to my mind. Sometimes it's difficult to choose the right decision,\" Alcaraz said following his semi-final win against Musetti. \"But I'm trying to improve that part of my game, trying not to think too much and do the right things always, even if it is not the brilliant shot or the brilliant decision.\"{{player.PlayerFirstName}}{{player.PlayerLastName}}{{player.PlayerCountryCode}}{{player.PlayerLastName}}{{player.PartnerLastName}}{{player.Record}}Vswins{{opponent.Record}}Show H2H Detail{{opponent.PlayerFirstName}}{{opponent.PlayerLastName}}{{opponent.PlayerCountryCode}}{{ opponent.PlayerLastName }}{{opponent.PartnerLastName}}{{player.Ranking}}Rank{{opponent.Ranking}}{{player.Age ? player.Age : '-'}}Age{{opponent.Age ? opponent.Age : '-'}}Read more from RomeSinner sets Alcaraz Rome final after huge Paul scareAlcaraz fights past Musetti, secures Rome final spotRivalry rekindled: Alcaraz vs. Sinner XIAlcaraz's aim: 'Do the right thing, even if it's not brilliant'What time is the Rome final between Sinner & Alcaraz?What awaits on Sunday is more than just a final ‚Äî it‚Äôs the next chapter in a rivalry that has already delivered some of the most electric tennis of the decade.
